    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Professionally, I am a passionate people-oriented problem-solver. I thrive
      in team settings as a teacher, administrator, and creative. With strategic
      thinking and an empathetic approach, I excel at identifying organizational
      needs, brainstorming effective solutions, and encouraging teams as they
      implement new processes. I aspire to foster a healthy, creative culture
      wherever I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not at work, I enjoy learning coding languages for web
      development, playing piano, practicing my Spanish language skills,
      reading, and playing with my dog, Valerie, and my cat Nesta. On weekends,
      you are likely to find me in a coffee shop with friends or roaming the
      book aisle at Target.
